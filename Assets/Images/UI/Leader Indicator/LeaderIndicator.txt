Leader Indicator:

Needs to play when the current leader of the game changes. All of the objects are parented under 'LeaderObject/LeaderPanel' in the HUD. When there's a new leader,
the 'Slide' trigger needs to be activated on the animators on the 'LeaderBottomBar' & 'LeaderBackground' objects - it should be pretty much the same as
the ScoreIndicators, except only the 'SlideIn' animation needs to be played.

Depending on the player's colour, three things need to be changed. The Image Colour for the 'LeaderBackground' object needs to be changed to whatever
the new leader's colour is. The Image for the 'LeaderText' object needs to be changed to the corresponding player's colour - the image files are
under Assets/Images/UI/Leader Indicator , they're each called LeaderIndicator*Colour*Text.png. Lastly, the Image for the 'LeaderPlayerHead' object
needs to be changed in the same way, the head files are under Assets/Images/Player Heads , all called PlayerHead*Colour*.png
